/*
    (Physics: finding runway length) Given an airplaneâ€™s acceleration a and take-off
    speed v, you can compute the minimum runway length needed for an airplane to
    take off using the following formula:
    length = v2 / 2a
    Write a program that prompts the user to enter v in meters/second (m/s) and the
    acceleration a in meters/second squared (m/s2), and displays the minimum runway
    length.
